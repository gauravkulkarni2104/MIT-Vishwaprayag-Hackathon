## Development Journey

We are building this system in structured phases to ensure scalability, modularity, and cloud readiness.

---

## Phase 1 – Planning & Architecture

- Define system requirements  
- Design 4 core portals  
- Plan cloud-based deployment  
- Create backend folder structure  
- Design database schema  

---

## Phase 2 – Backend Development

- Initialize Flask application  
- Configure database connection  
- Create models:
  - User  
  - Hospital  
  - DiseaseCase  
  - Inventory  
  - Patient  
  - Appointment  
- Develop REST API endpoints  
- Implement basic CRUD operations  

---

## Phase 3 – Frontend Development

- Design single-page dashboard layout  
- Create 4 portal sections:
  - Disease Surveillance  
  - Hospital Resource Management  
  - Admin Dashboard  
  - Citizen Portal  
- Connect frontend with backend APIs  
- Add charts and analytics visualization  

---

## Phase 4 – Cloud Integration
